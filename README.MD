# Portfolio Website

Thanks for visiting my GitHub and my portfolio website!

## Repository Overview

This GitHub repo has the source code for my portfolio website, where I decided to use HTML, CSS, and JS due to interesting design choices that I think you might like! Here are reasons I chose the basics for this small website:

- **No flashing buffer refreshes**: notice how there aren't any flashes of white light every time you 'change pages'?
- **Won't lose connection**: during development, the university internet wasn't always the greatest, and would cut out. Since the 'pages' are all actually HTML elements, if you load the website before losing wi-fi, you can continue using it.
- **Black and white main theme**: I really just wanted the main point of the website to be readability and accessibility for all.

## Technologies Used

As stated before this website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I am currently learning react and other frameworks too!

## Later implementations

- possibly light mode/dark mode toggle
- different language translations once I become fluent
